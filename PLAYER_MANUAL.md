## 4. Power-Ups & Drops

Enemies drop power-ups when destroyed. Four categories:

### Weapon UPGRADE (permanent)
| Drop | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **UPGRADE** | Weapon level **+1** (up to level 5) |

Your weapon evolves as you collect UPGRADE drops:

| Level | Name | Bullets | Damage | Fire Rate |
|-------|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Single** | 1 | Normal | Normal |
| 2 | **Dual** | 2 | Normal | Normal |
| 3 | **Dual+** | 2 | +25% | +15% faster |
| 4 | **Triple** | 3 | +50% | +30% faster |
| 5 | **Triple MAX** | 3 | +75% | +45% faster |

**Death penalty**: Each death drops your weapon **1 level** and removes your special.

### Special Weapons (temporary, 12s)
Exclusive — collecting one replaces the current special.

| Name | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **HOMING** | Bullets track the nearest enemy |
| **PIERCE** | Bullets pass through enemies |
| **MISSILE** | Fewer bullets but huge AoE explosions |

### Elemental Perks (permanent, drop as diamond crystals)
Collected in fixed order. Each adds a permanent elemental effect to your bullets:

| Order | Element | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1st | **Fire** | Kills cause splash damage (30%) to nearby enemies |
| 2nd | **Laser** | Bullets +25% speed, +1 pierce |
| 3rd | **Electric** | Kills chain lightning to 1-2 nearby enemies (20% damage) |

Collecting all 3 activates **GODCHAIN**! Further perk drops re-trigger it. Death resets all perks.

### Utility Drops (temporary, 12s)
Capsule-shaped pickups with distinct visuals.

| Name | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **SHIELD** | Absorbs one hit |
| **SPEED** | Movement speed +40% |

## 6. Central Bank Bosses

Every 5 waves you face a boss. Rotation: **FED → ECB → BOJ**

| Boss | Symbol | Style |
|------|--------|-------|
| **THE FED** | $ | Aggressive, rapid attacks |
| **ECB** | € | Bureaucratic, bullet walls |
| **BOJ** | ¥ | Zen, lethal precision |

**3 Phases per Boss:**
- **Phase 1** (100%-66% HP): Slow, simple patterns
- **Phase 2** (66%-33% HP): Fast, complex patterns
- **Phase 3** (33%-0% HP): Erratic, maximum danger!

**Boss Drops**: Every **40 hits** on a boss drops a power-up. Keep shooting!

---

## 7. Advanced Mechanics

### HYPER MODE - Maximum Risk, Maximum Reward

Kill enemies at close range to fill the **DIP meter**. When it reaches 100%, HYPER activates automatically:

| Aspect | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Duration** | 10 seconds (fixed) |
| **Score** | **5x multiplier** on ALL points |
| **Weapon** | Temporary **+2 weapon levels** (LV6/LV7!) |
| **Hitbox** | 50% LARGER (more risk!) |
| **Death** | **INSTANT** if hit (bypasses lives) |
| **Cooldown** | 8 seconds after HYPER ends |
| **DIP Meter** | Freezes during HYPER, resets to zero when it ends |

**Strategy**: Activate HYPER when enemies are clustered. The temporary weapon boost makes you devastating!

### GODCHAIN - Ultimate Power

When you collect **all 3 Elemental Perks** (Fire + Laser + Electric), GODCHAIN activates automatically:
- 10 second duration with massive visual effects (golden aura, meteors)
- Further perk drops **re-trigger GODCHAIN**
- GODCHAIN combined with HYPER reaches weapon levels 6-7 — absolute destruction!

**The cycle**: Collect perk drops → Fire → Laser → Electric → GODCHAIN! → collect more perks → GODCHAIN again!

## 8. Pro Tips

### Kill Close for DIP
Kill enemies when they're **close to your ship** vertically:
- Fills the **DIP meter** faster
- Full meter = HYPER READY!
- Boss hits also contribute to the meter

### Tactical Shield (Utility Drop)
When you pick up a SHIELD capsule:
- Absorbs the **next hit** for 12 seconds
- Doesn't stack — grab it when you need protection
- Great for surviving Boss Phase 3 attacks

### Weapon Level Management
- **Death costs 1 level** and **resets all elemental perks**
- Prioritize both UPGRADE and PERK drops to rebuild after death
- After death, UPGRADE drops help you recover weapon level quickly

### Wave Strategy
Waves get harder as you clear them:
- **0-30%**: Setup phase, learn the patterns
- **30-85%**: Build phase, pressure increases
- **85%+**: PANIC phase, enemies fire 40% faster!
