## 7. Advanced Mechanics

### ⚡ HYPER MODE - Maximum Risk, Maximum Reward

When your **Graze Meter** reaches 100%, press **H** to activate HYPER:

| Aspect | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Duration** | 5 seconds base (+0.3s per graze) |
| **Score** | **5x multiplier** on ALL points |
| **Hitbox** | 50% LARGER (more risk!) |
| **Death** | **INSTANT** if hit (bypasses lives) |
| **Cooldown** | 8 seconds after HYPER ends |

**Strategy**: Activate HYPER when enemies are clustered. Graze during HYPER extends the timer!

### 🔥 SATOSHI'S SACRIFICE - The Ultimate Gamble

When you're on your **last life** and about to die, time slows and a golden **₿** button appears:

| If you ACCEPT | Result |
|---------------|--------|
| **Cost** | ALL your score resets to 0 |
| **Reward** | 10 seconds of **TOTAL INVINCIBILITY** |
| **Scoring** | **10x multiplier** during Sacrifice |
| **Success** | Earn back your score = **+1 EXTRA LIFE** |
| **Failure** | Earn less = You survive anyway |

**The Satoshi Gamble**: Can you earn back everything you lost in 10 seconds?

## 8. Pro Tips

### 💎 **HODL MODE** - The Champion's Secret
**Stop moving** and your ship enters HODL mode:
- **2x damage** against all enemies
- **Golden aura** visible around ship

Use HODL when enemies are lined up above you!

### 🔥 **Graze** - Dance with Danger
Pass **close to enemy bullets** without getting hit:
- Build up the **Graze Meter** (side bar)
- Higher meter = higher **score multiplier** (up to 2.5x)
- **Full meter = HYPER READY!**

### 🛡️ **Tactical Shield**
Shield has a 10-second cooldown. Use it to:
- Pass through bullet walls
- Survive Boss Phase 3 attacks
- Emergency escape when grazing goes wrong

### ⚡ **Boss Power-Ups**
During boss fights, every **25 hits** drops a power-up. Keep shooting!

### 🎯 **Last Enemy Bonus**
The final enemy of each wave gives **2x points** - hunt them down!

### 📊 **Wave Intensity**
Waves get harder as you clear them:
- **0-30%**: Setup phase, learn the patterns
- **30-85%**: Build phase, pressure increases
- **85%+**: PANIC phase, enemies fire 40% faster!
