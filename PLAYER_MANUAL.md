4. **Defeat the Boss** - Collect the **Evolution Core** to upgrade your weapon!

## 4. Power-Ups & Drops

Enemies drop power-ups when destroyed. Three categories:

### Weapon Evolution (permanent, from Boss kills)
Weapons no longer drop from enemies. Instead, defeating a **Boss** spawns an **Evolution Core** — a glowing cyan diamond that flies to your ship with a cinematic sequence (slowmo + shockwave), upgrading your weapon permanently for the run.

| Level | Name | Bullets | Damage | Fire Rate |
|-------|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Single** | 1 | Normal | Normal |
| 2 | **Dual** | 2 | +30% | +15% faster |
| 3 | **Triple MAX** | 3 | +70% | +35% faster |

HYPER mode temporarily boosts your weapon by +2 levels (max effective LV5):

| Level | Name | Bullets | Damage | Fire Rate |
|-------|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| 4 | **HYPER+** | 3 | +100% | +55% faster |
| 5 | **HYPER++** | 3 | +125% | +70% faster |

Each weapon level changes the ship visually — bigger pods, longer barrels — and the **muzzle flash** fires from the actual cannon positions, growing brighter and larger as you power up. Elemental perks tint the flash (red/cyan/violet/fire).

**No death penalty on weapons** — your weapon level is permanent for the entire run. Death removes your special weapon and resets elemental perks.

### Special Weapons (temporary, 12s)
Exclusive — collecting one replaces the current special.

| Name | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **HOMING** | Bullets track the nearest enemy |
| **PIERCE** | Bullets pass through enemies |
| **MISSILE** | Fewer bullets but huge AoE explosions |

### Elemental Perks (permanent, drop as diamond crystals)
Collected in fixed order. Each adds a permanent elemental effect to your bullets and a **visible ship aura**:

| Order | Element | Effect | Ship Aura |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------|
| 1st | **Fire** | Kills cause napalm splash — expanding ring + flame tongues + embers | Orange glow, rising embers |
| 2nd | **Laser** | Fires a Gradius-style beam bolt (+25% speed, +1 pierce) with impact sparks and pierce flash | Cyan glow, trail particles |
| 3rd | **Electric** | Kills unleash jagged lightning bolts to 1-2 nearby enemies | Violet glow, crackling arcs |

Each perk pickup triggers a **colored screen flash** and **elemental burst** matching the element. Contagion cascade kills show visible **connection lines** between chained enemies.

Collecting all 3 activates **GODCHAIN** with a spectacular apotheosis burst (symbol explosion + gold rings)! Further perk drops re-trigger it. Death resets all perks.

### Utility Drops (temporary, 12s)
Capsule-shaped pickups with distinct visuals.

| Name | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **SHIELD** | Absorbs one hit |
| **SPEED** | Movement speed +40% |

## 6. Central Bank Bosses

Every 5 waves you face a boss. Rotation: **FED → ECB → BOJ**

| Boss | Symbol | Style |
|------|--------|-------|
| **THE FED** | $ | Aggressive, rapid attacks |
| **ECB** | € | Bureaucratic, bullet walls |
| **BOJ** | ¥ | Zen, lethal precision |

**3 Phases per Boss:**
- **Phase 1** (100%-66% HP): Slow, simple patterns
- **Phase 2** (66%-33% HP): Fast, complex patterns
- **Phase 3** (33%-0% HP): Erratic, maximum danger!

**Boss Drops**: Every **40 hits** on a boss drops a power-up. Keep shooting!

**Evolution Core**: When a boss is defeated, it drops an **Evolution Core** — a cinematic sequence with chain explosions, coin rain, and a glowing diamond that flies to your ship, upgrading your weapon by +1 level.

## 7. Advanced Mechanics

### HYPER MODE - Maximum Risk, Maximum Reward

Kill enemies at close range to fill the **DIP meter**. When it reaches 100%, HYPER activates automatically:

| Aspect | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Duration** | 10 seconds (fixed) |
| **Score** | **5x multiplier** on ALL points |
| **Weapon** | Temporary **+2 weapon levels** (LV4/LV5!) |
| **Hitbox** | 50% LARGER (more risk!) |
| **Death** | **INSTANT** if hit (bypasses lives) |
| **Cooldown** | 8 seconds after HYPER ends |
| **DIP Meter** | Freezes during HYPER, resets to zero when it ends |

**Strategy**: Activate HYPER when enemies are clustered. The temporary weapon boost makes you devastating!

### GODCHAIN - Ultimate Power

When you collect **all 3 Elemental Perks** (Fire + Laser + Electric), GODCHAIN activates automatically:
- 10 second duration with massive visual effects (golden aura, meteors)
- Further perk drops **re-trigger GODCHAIN**
- GODCHAIN combined with HYPER reaches weapon levels 4-5 — absolute destruction!

**The cycle**: Collect perk drops → Fire → Laser → Electric → GODCHAIN! → collect more perks → GODCHAIN again!

## 8. Arcade Mode — Rogue Protocol

Arcade Mode is a distinct roguelike experience. No story, no chapters — just pure combat with escalating challenge and accumulating power.

### How It Works
1. Play through 5 waves → defeat the Boss
2. **Choose a Modifier** (pick 1 of 3 cards) — permanent for the rest of the run
3. Repeat — every cycle gets harder, but you get stronger
4. No ending — survive as long as you can!

### Combo System
- Kill enemies in quick succession to build a **combo chain**
- Each kill resets a 3-second timer — let it expire and combo resets to 0
- **Graze** enemy bullets to extend the timer by 0.5s
- Score multiplier: **1.0x + (combo × 0.05)**, capped at **5.0x** (80 combo)
- Displayed as "×N COMBO" in the top-right corner, color shifts white → yellow → orange → red
- Getting hit resets the combo

### Modifiers (15 total)
Modifiers are permanent upgrades chosen after boss and mini-boss defeats.

**OFFENSE (Red)**
| Name | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Overclock** | Fire rate +20% (stacks 2x) |
| **Armor Piercing** | All bullets +1 pierce (stacks) |
| **Volatile Rounds** | Kills cause 30px AoE (50% damage) |
| **Critical Hit** | 15% chance for 3x damage (stacks to 30%) |
| **Chain Lightning** | Kills chain to 1 nearby enemy (30% damage) |

**DEFENSE (Cyan)**
| Name | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Nano Shield** | Auto-shield every 45s |
| **Extra Life** | +1 life (stacks) |
| **Bullet Time** | Enemy bullets -20% speed (stacks 2x) |
| **Wider Graze** | Graze radius +40% |
| **Last Stand** | Survive one lethal hit per cycle |

**WILD (Magenta)** — High risk, high reward!
| Name | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Double Score** | Score 2x but enemies +25% HP |
| **Bullet Hell** | Enemies fire +40% but drops +60% |
| **Speed Demon** | Everything +25% speed (you AND enemies) |
| **Jackpot** | Pity timers halved but -1 life |
| **Berserker** | Damage +50% but no shield drops |

### Mini-Bosses
In Arcade, mini-bosses spawn more frequently (lower kill thresholds, 10s cooldown). Defeating one lets you **pick 1 of 2 modifier cards** — a bonus power-up!

### Post-Cycle 3 Scaling
After defeating all 3 bosses (FED→ECB→BOJ), the game loops back through wave definitions with:
- +20% difficulty per extra cycle
- 40% chance of remixed formations
- Boss rotation continues: C4=FED, C5=ECB, C6=BOJ...
- No cap — how far can you go?

### Arcade Pacing
- Faster intermissions (2s vs Story's 3.2s)
- +15% more enemies per wave
- -15% enemy HP (more kills = more combos!)
- Higher base drop rate (+10%)

## 10. Pro Tips

### Kill Close for DIP
Kill enemies when they're **close to your ship** vertically:
- Fills the **DIP meter** faster
- Full meter = HYPER READY!
- Boss hits also contribute to the meter

### Tactical Shield
Activate your shield to become **invulnerable for 5 seconds** (10s cooldown):
- **PC**: Press **Down Arrow** or **S**
- **Mobile**: **Quick tap on your ship** — look for the glowing cyan fins!
- A glowing hexagonal energy grid surrounds your ship while active
- Your ship's fins glow cyan to show cooldown progress — when they pulse brightly, shield is ready

### Weapon & Perk Management
- **Weapon level is permanent** — death does NOT reduce it
- **Death resets all elemental perks** and removes your special weapon
- Prioritize PERK diamond drops to rebuild your elemental chain after death
- Weapons only upgrade from boss Evolution Cores — defeat bosses to grow stronger!

### Wave Strategy
Waves get harder as you clear them:
- **0-30%**: Setup phase, learn the patterns
- **30-85%**: Build phase, pressure increases
- **85%+**: PANIC phase, enemies fire 40% faster!
